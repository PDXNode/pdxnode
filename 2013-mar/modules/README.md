# node modules you should know: `through`

[through](http://npm.im/through) makes building your own streams fun and easy!

* it handles [modifying inflight data and buffering output](./part-1/) (in which we make a loudbot)
* and [pausing incoming data](./part-2/) (in which we make a tiny server that writes POST data to disk)
* and [filtering incoming data](./part-3/) (in which we make the world's tiniest autocomplete!)

In short, it's a great building block for writing your own user-land streams!
