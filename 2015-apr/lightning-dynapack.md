# Dynapack

This will be an introductory talk on Dynapack, a module bundler and loader
I built that promises to:

- download only the js you need to show the current page,
- never download the same thing twice, and
- minimize network requests.

The goal is speedy initial page loads, multi-page apps that feel like
single-page apps, isomorphism, buzz-phrase, and other buzz-phrase :).

I was trying to bootstrap a nonprofit startup (maybe I still am), but am now on
the job hunt. I use Node.js for everything web; it seems silly to write code
twice for the server and the browser the goal is to render HTML!
