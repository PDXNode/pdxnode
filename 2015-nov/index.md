# rabin, screencat, waffle.js

Max gave a few short talks on:

[screencat](https://github.com/maxogden/screencat): Screencat is an electron app that lets you share/pair screens over webRTC.  Max gave a code tour and pointed out a few notable ingredients:

- [electron](http://electron.atom.io/): Build cross platform desktop node apps
- [menubar](https://github.com/maxogden/menubar): Provides boilerplate for menubar electron apps.
- [electron-packager](https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager): Package and distribute your Electron app in OS executables (.app, .exe etc) via JS or CLI
- [electron-prebuilt](https://github.com/mafintosh/electron-prebuilt) Install atom-shell prebuilts using npm
- [robotjs](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs) Node.js Desktop Automation. Control the mouse, keyboard, and read the screen.

[rabin](https://github.com/maxogden/rabin):  One of Max's first native C++ addons for node.js.  Its a node native addon for rabin fingerprinting data streams but the talk was focused on writing native modules.

- [nan](https://github.com/nodejs/nan): Native Abstractions for Node.js.  This provides a compatibility layer used when writing native addons for node.
- [mknod](https://github.com/mafintosh/mknod) Another good example of native addon to learn from.
- [goingnative](https://github.com/workshopper/goingnative) A nodeschool that teaches native addon development.

[waffle.js](https://wafflejs.com/) is the whimsical counterpart to node.js meetups.  It will happen on the east side of town, include waffles and some set of musical instruments, and happen around [Node Interactive](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/node-interactive).
