# The First NodeOS Talk

> warning: here be asynchronous dragons

NodeOS is an attempt to use npm as a full-fledged operating system package manager. A base NodeOS image includes node, and a few other modules to let npm take over.
The end goal is to provide a working OS on top of the Linux kernel whose user land is entirely distributed via npm.

Attendees who have access to [Docker](http://docker.io) during the talk will get to publish and test modules on their local NodeOS instances.

**Check back here** for an update before *Thursday*, I will post a docker image to pre-download
