# Presentation Night Script

## At beginning of night, announce:

- Share/thanks sponsors(venue, food/bev, etc.)
- Welcome everyone. *Raise hands as organizers to say hi.*
- "We have a CoC. See it in the repo. Long story short: 'Don't be a jerk'. If something happens that makes you
feel uncomfortable, please talk with any of our organizers. They are friendly and happy to help."

- **Are you new to Node?** If you're new and want to get up and running for the first time on your machine, please let any of the organizers know, and we will do our best to help you get Node up and running for you. We can also answer any questions you have along the way.

- **Who's hiring?** Ask the group to 'raise your hand if you're looking for work,' then ask the group if 'anyone is hiring please raise your hand.' Then invite individuals and teams who're looking to hire people for open positions to breifly talk about them, and invite people who're looking for work to connect with people who're hiring.

- Do we have any upcoming events? Workshops? Hardware nights we should all know about?

- **Introduce Speakers:** Remind everyone that our speakers are amazing and always learning, and that we should be kind and encouraging!
- And please ask questions during the talk! We're all here to learn.
