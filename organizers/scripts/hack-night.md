# Hack Night Script

## At beginning of night, announce:

- Share/thanks sponsors(venue, food/bev, etc.)
- Welcome everyone. *Raise hands as organizers to say hi.*
- "We have a CoC. See it in the repo. Long story short: 'Don't be a jerk'. If something happens that makes you feel uncomfortable, please talk with any of our organizers. They are friendly and happy to help."

- If small enough group (<= 15): go around the room and have everyone give a brief introduction of themselves to everyone.

- Explain the purpose of the evening: 'the night is yours!' Work on the projects you haven't had the time to get to. Start a project you work on regularly with a group every hacknight! Hang out and talk about Node, or anything you'd like to! We're really happy you're here, and hope you really enjoy yourself.

- If large enough group (> 20): introduce the 'regional' map (which you've drawn on a whiteboard), and let the group know about which tables and spaces are designated for: individual hacking, group hacking, and 'just getting started' with Node. Also introduce unconference-style sticky-note board for people to write and post their group-project titles for others to check out and join in on.

- Introduce 'End of Night' Show and Tell list for people to sign up for if they'd like.

- Turn group loose to start hacking and hanging out.

- ~40 minutes before wrapping up remind group about signing up for the project show-and-tell.

- Start the show-and-tell at the appropriate time before closing depending on how many people sign up.

## When closing the night:

- "Thanks for coming! Y'all are rad."
- Remind group about upcoming PDXNode Presentation Night, and ask if there are any other upcoming events they'd like to mention.

### Organizers running event:

- Map out room on whiteboard with designated areas for: Individual hacking, Group Hacking, and hanging out/socializing.
- Start 'End of Night' Show and Tell list on whiteboard.
- Make a space for sticky-note board.
