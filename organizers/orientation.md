# PDXNode Organizer Orientation

## Description
This "living" document provides resources and a general guide for new PDXNode organizers to jump in!

## Organizer Roles
We're so grateful you're here to help! One key aspect about being a regular PDXNode organizer is to fill needed roles so we can evenly distribute the load of what it takes to make this happen! The best way to see where you can join in and fill current needs best is to jump in the conversation at our weekly videochat meetings (described further down in this doc) where we can all talk in person. Super stoked you're here. :D

## Presentation Nights vs. Hack Nights
PDXNode produces two differnt types of meetup every month.

Every 2nd Thursday we put on a presentation night at [Vacasa](https://www.vacasa.com/contact-us/) where the goal is to provide high-quality presentations from people in the Node community locally and abroad. At the present we typically have local speakers present in person, and other geographically distributed speakers present remotely via talky.io.

Every last Thursday we put on a hack night at [Ctrl-h Hackerspace](http://pdxhackerspace.org/) where the goal is to provide a fun and easy-going environment for individuals & groups to hack on their own projects and as questions along the way, as well as support begginers and people who're new to Node with help in answering questions and pair-coding.

## Weekly Videochat & Meeting Recap GoogleDoc
Every Thursday evening at 7pm we have a videochat. It typically lasts 10-15 minutes, but is subject to go a bit longer depending on the ground we have to cover for meetup preparation that week. Weekly meeting notes are documented in a GoogleDoc (you'll need to obtain view/edit permission from another orgainzer).

## Meetup.com Org
Our [meetup.com org](https://www.meetup.com/pdxnode/) is our main point of connection and scheduling for our attendees. Group-wide emails and discussions are written and sent by organizers from the 'group tools' panel here. Please contact [obensource](https://twitter.com/obensource) to be added as a co-organizer and to get access for group tools.

## Github Repo
Most of our meetup resources and other helpful docs (such as this) currently live [here](https://github.com/PDXNode/pdxnode). Feel free to clone and add resources, or PR changes as needed.

## Twitter & Buffer
We have a Twitter account which we want to keep active and relevant for our meetups & events. This is a great place to remind people about meetups & events that are happening, going to happen, and share resources from meetups that have happened (eg. videos). We also try to share general and relevant Node resources as we see them. The PDXNode twitter account is also linked to a buffer account so if you'd like access to post or schedule tweets–please contact [obensource](https://twitter.com/obensource).

## YouTube
We currently have a filmographer capturing and making videos of all our presentation night talks, and we're posting them on our [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI8MIw5A7ALtIvNHsrYJbjg). If you need access to this account please contact [obensource](https://twitter.com/obensource).

## Gmail
If you need access to our gmail account (eg. to contact possible or present sponsors), please contact [obensource](https://twitter.com/obensource) for the login credentials.

## OpenCollective
PDXNode has an account with [open collective](https://opencollective.com/pdxnode) where we're shifting towards storing our sponsorship funds. OpenCollective is a handy way to let sponsors deposit funds to an account which we can withdrawl from, and OpenCollective cleanly takes care of the legal reponsibilities theirin so we don't have to. All organizers should have access to this in order to withdrawl for sponsorship as we need–please contact [obensource](https://twitter.com/obensource) to learn more and gain access. Also, anyone in our sponsor-finding role should be able to concisely describe what this is to potential sponsors in order for them to use it.
