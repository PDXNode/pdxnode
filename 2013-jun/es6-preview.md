# Node and ES6

The next version of the ECMAScript standard (ES6) is due to be to be finalized this year. Experimental implementations of new features are already making their way into v8. This talk will outline some of those features that are currently available in Node.js, and demo a few fun examples of what we can do with them.

Length: 20-30 minutes

## David Manning

I'm a developer for [Shift Solutions] [1]. We design and build services that aide the [AEC] [2] industry. We use Node.js because of its flexibility and general applicability to diverse problem sets.

I'm interested in the forthcoming features of ES6 because I like to play with new toys.

## Outline

Some features I'll be talking about:

1. [Generators](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:generators)
2. [Maps, Weak Maps and Sets](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:simple_maps_and_sets)
3. [Object.observe](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:observe)
