# Proposed Talk: viewing video on vimeo of Eric Gradman called “Node's Harder Side” 
===================================================================================
### and, most importantly, having a discussion thereafter.

this would be not so much a talk as watching the 20 minute video by eric gradman from the JS.LA conference,
given on february 28th, 2013, where eric talks about his creation of the virsix project at a hotel in
washington state. this was a project done with a number of raspberry pi boards and a server to create
a four-room, live video game you could touch and interact with. and of course, the software behind all of
it was node.js. faddah plans to show the video through an hdmi output to a screen from his iPad, then
lead a discussion about it.

the video, and how he shows what he did in it, is pretty amazing and inspiring for node server and electronics
and bot coders, and can be found at:  https://vimeo.com/60993092 .

### About Faddah:
Faddah Steve Yuetsu Wolf, a man with just too damn many names, is a 60s/70s throw back ever posing the 
question to Porpsters, “why all the hating on the hippies?” Though he has a Performing Arts BFA degree, 
he has been tinkering with computers, software and gadgets since 1987. He has done tech support, QA and 
various forms of software engineering. An early beta version of his name appears in the “thank yous” to 
the Yes mid-90s album, “Talk,” for assisting in pulling the midi info on their hard drive back from the 
depths. Whether he should be thanked or damned for doing so depends on how you feel about the band/album. 
He also has practiced [zen meditation since 1996](http://www.amazon.com/What-Is-Zen-Alan-Watts/dp/1577311671), 
which is partly responsible for the growth of his name, and in the last two years has become quite the 
yoga junkie, preferring his prawna deep fried.

He has been a [Burning Man](http://burningman.com/) [Black Rock Ranger](http://www.rangers.org/) and led 
meditation sessions out there at the “playa zendo.”  He also is quite a fan of the music Django Reinhardt 
(the French Gypsy Jazz Guitar Player, not the web programming language), and gave a talk on Gypsy Jazz, 
as well as music performance, at [Portland’s Ignite 9](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCtrzzllg). 
Thankfully, no one in that audience seems to have been harmed by this experience. His writing can also be 
found on the blog, [i also went...](http://ialsowent.com), and he keeps threatening to do something with [140 movie review](http://140moviereview.com), 
the latter based on the twitter account. His musings can also be seen at various comedy Open Mics and Showcases 
around greater Portland. He also refers to himself as “pleasure activist” and “beer snob.” Oh, and he has 
fallen deeply in love with Portland as a transplant; for it’s strong coffee, stronger women, tasteful micro-
crafted beer, and it’s wild, Open Source Heart.
