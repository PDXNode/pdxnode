# Proposed Talk: viewing video on vimeo of Eric Gradman called “Node's Harder Side” and, most importantly, 
# having a discussion thereafter.

# this would be not so much a talk as watching the 20 minute video by eric gradman from the JS.LA conference,
# given on february 28th, 2013, where eric talks about his creation of the virsix project at a hotel in
# washington state. this was a project done with a number of raspberry pi boards and a server to create
# a four-room, live video game you could touch and interact with. and of course, the software behind all of
# it was node.js. faddah plans to show the video through an hdmi output to a screen from his iPad, then
# lead a discussion about it.

# the video, and how he shows what he did in it, is pretty amazing and inspiring for node server and electronics
# and bot coders, and can be found at:  https://vimeo.com/60993092 .

# About Faddah:
# Faddah Steve Yuetsu Wolf, a man with just too damn many names, is a 60s/70s throw back ever posing the 
# question to Porpsters, “why all the hating on the hippies?” Though he has a Performing Arts BFA degree, 
# he has been tinkering with computers, software and gadgets since 1987. He has done tech support, QA and 
# various forms of software engineering. An early beta version of his name appears in the “thank yous” to 
# the Yes mid-90s album, “Talk,” for assisting in pulling the midi info on their hard drive back from the 
# depths. Whether he should be thanked or damned for doing so depends on how you feel about the band/album. 
# He also has practiced zen meditation since 1996 (http://www.amazon.com/What-Is-Zen-Alan-Watts/dp/1577311671), 
# which is partly responsible for the growth of his name, and in the last two years has become quite the 
# yoga junkie, preferring his prawna deep fried.

# He has been a Burning Man (http://burningman.com/) Black Rock Ranger (http://www.rangers.org/) and led 
# meditation sessions out there at the “playa zendo.”  He also is quite a fan of the music Django Reinhardt 
# (the French Gypsy Jazz Guitar Player, not the web programming language), and gave a talk on Gypsy Jazz, 
# as well as music performance, at Portland’s Ignite 9 (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCtrzzllg). 
# Thankfully, no one in that audience seems to have been harmed by this experience. His writing can also be 
# found on the blog, http://ialsowent.com, and he keeps threatening to do something with http://140moviereview.com, 
# the latter based on the twitter account. His musings can also be seen at various comedy Open Mics and Showcases 
# around greater Portland. He also refers to himself as “pleasure activist” and “beer snob.” Oh, and he has 
# fallen deeply in love with Portland as a transplant; for it’s strong coffee, stronger women, tasteful micro-
# crafted beer, and it’s wild, Open Source Heart.
