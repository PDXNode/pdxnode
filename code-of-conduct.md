# Code of Conduct

PDXNode is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any meetup venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave civilly. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for PDXNode.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the meetup, and may be refused entrance to future meetups.

## long-form

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, 
deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Offensive jokes are not appropriate for PDXNode.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the organizers may expel that participant and refuse them entrance to any further meetups.

## credit where credit is due

This code of conduct is largely drawn from [PyCon's code of conduct](https://us.pycon.org/2012/codeofconduct/), and like anything else PDXNode-related, is entirely in the hands
of the PDXNode community for editing.
