pdxnode hacks SEPoCoNI
=======

### Represent pdxnode at the 3rd SEPoCoNI of the month: March 22, 2013.

"Come hang out and write code in a quieter, less crowded environment with your fellow nerds.
	The meetings are extremely informal, and everyone is welcome!"

To complement the monthly first Thursday presentation night, we'll be meeting every third Thursday 
	as part of the SEPoCoNI meetup at Side Door. Throw around ideas, get help on projects, imbibe delicious beverages.
