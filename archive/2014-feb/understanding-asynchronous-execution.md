# Understanding Asynchronous Execution.

We will be talking about what it means for Node to be a single threaded
asynchronous platform, what actually happens asynchronously, and what that
means to us. We will dip a little into what happens asynchronously in the
browser as well.

We will also take a very quick look at common JavaScript abstractions over
these asynchronous operations, callbacks, streams, event emitters, and promises.

This will be a very boring talk, but you will be able to read your
JavaScript more like a computer does and less like your squishy human
brain wants to read it.
