### Description: 

I gave a presentation ([available on vimeo](https://vimeo.com/84075744)) which describes the Scuttlebutt gossip protocol, and the vector clock that underlies it. I introduced node modules implementing both the [vector clock] [1] and the [scuttlebutt protocol][2], and showed off a [d3.js visualization][3] (only guaranteed to work in chrome) of the protocol in action.

Talk given at January 2014 PDXNode presentation night.

The slides are available [here][4]
