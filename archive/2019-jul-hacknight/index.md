## Meetup notes
* NodeBots event: advertised as [NodeBots Day and Robot Talent Show](https://www.meetup.com/pdxnode/events/ngpncpyzkbhc/)
* Around 20 people, in 6 teams, took up three tables at Ctrl-h.
* Attendees appreciated having a specific focus, and came up with a variety of more complex movements
* Led by @samrocksc, @mberka and Michael Cole assisting with electronics.

## Setup
* Had ~8 Arduino Uno boards and a Nano, all flashed with StandardFirmataPlus firmware at the last moment. Difficulties using Arduino on Linux, @mberka used VSCode + PlatformIO.

## Reflections, Improvements to be made
* Attendees liked the light-hearted custom certificates. Great work Sam and Michael!
* Minor technical challenges for some teams involving johnny-five and the node-bots-workshop tutorial.
* Feedback was very positive and attendees cleaned up after themselves thoroughly.
* Need to see whether anything longer-term can be done with the equipment.
