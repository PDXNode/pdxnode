## Presentation Night

### Markov Twain model - presentation by team from Alchemy Code Lab

* Generates text that looks like it could have been written by an author, using [markov npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markov). Uses 100k words of the author's text, input as a string.
* Mongoose model, stores results in MongoDB
* Uses [twit package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit) to tweet a sentence three times an hour (feed [@markovtwainbot](https://twitter.com/markovtwainbot)).
* Bad word filter.
* Considered merging authors to produced coauthored sentences, but there is a decline in comprehensibility.
* *Said I gravely, "this is a universal law of vegetable things".* - Edgar Allan Poe

### Getting involved in open source: a practical demo - Ben Michel

* Why? To fast-track your understanding, build a resume, give your career direction.
** Consider what you use and would like to see improved.
* Volunteer. What are you interested in? GraphQL?
* Look it up: GraphQL Foundation, GitHub project
  * Find the specification. The spec is typically first checked when there is an issue. Also the first place to look for opportunities to expand.
  * Look at the contributors. Find a welcoming one, ask whether they could use help. Twitter/GitHub message them. *Note: Ben can connect to the Node community.*
* Become an observer on a committee - find out what is on their minds.
* Paper: "[Programming Language Standardization: Patterns for Participation](http://wirfs-brock.com/allen/files/papers/standpats-asianplop2016.pdf)", Allen Wirfs-Brock

#### How to get involved

* Listen first, learn the history
* Volunteer to take minutes - always appreciated.
* Plan your niche? Look for what is under-invested. i18n?
* Find your allies, pick your battles.

## Announcements

* Various JS and related software job openings.
* Coming in March: Andrew Chalkley discussing his Node-compatible JavaScript IoT package, a fresh take on his prior JavaScript of Things project. *Note: Coronavirus-related challenges made February the last meeting for the next few months.*

## Reflections, Improvements to be made

* Technical problems forced change to alternate laptop that had some quirks but eventually provided full audiovisual. The group was patient.
* Quickly-produced full-length presentation provided much-needed substance to the night. Some logistical difficulties running an interactive event remotely; may need to give prior notice so that attendees can come knowing what they would like to contribute to, rather than the speaker having to come up with a direction (for which they might not have long-term enthusiasm). This may be interesting as a hack night topic: "We are all going to show up and contribute some open source! Bring an issue or get one from this list!"
* Thanks to Ben, Faddah, and the Markov Twain team!
