# Grunt: the JS Makefile

In this talk, I'll talk about Grunt, an alternative for Makefiles, written in
Javascript. I'll walk the group through some of the interesting plugins that
ship with Grunt, and a brief tour of how to write your own plugin.

## Speaker Justin Abrahms

I'm an engineer at [Sprint.ly](https://sprint.ly/), a kickass project
management place in town. I've done a bunch of Python stuff in the past. I'm
using Node currently on a yet unlaunched marketing website for someone.

We use this tool (Grunt), to run lint, our tests, and general code-quality level things.
