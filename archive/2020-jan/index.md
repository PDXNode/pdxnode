# Jan 9 2020

## Meetup Notes

* Presentation at Alchemy Code Lab, in the classroom. 32 in attendance.
* With thanks to our sponsors: Mocha, Alchemy, Ctrl^H, InVision, O'Reilly.
* Node Jeopardy with store passes.
* Led by Ben @obensource, with help from @MBerka and @faddah.

## Community Night - Group discussion

### NodeJs

What tech do you feel like you need to learn the most this year? (Doesn't have to be new) Why?

* TypeScript (in high use), especially how to migrate it (automated tooling) and what are the benefits?
* Machine Learning - as applied to Node? JS Frameworks and integrations exist. May be valuable to know how to use them. [Course from Infinite Red](https://infinite.red/machinelearning). What is used? TensorFlowJS, various cloud-based services. Practical examples of how to set that up?
* Docker. How do you migrate to it? How do you automate e.g. an Angular build?
* Agile and other software methodologies. Someone from the environment (Ward Cunningham?). Team size?
* Leveraging Serverless like Firebase, AWS Lambda.
* Server-side framework rendering with e.g. Next.js.

What tech do you think is going to be the most interesting to learn about or work with this year? Why?

* WebGL
* RealTime / WebSockets?
* WebAssembly

What developments are you most excited about with JS and/or Node this year? Why?

* Library Jobo - for voice, used by Alexa, etc.
* **Showcase - share your / a shared NPM package.**

What aspects of JS, Node, or other tech in general is most relevant to your current role? How do you think that is going to evolve this year (and over time)?

### Portland Tech Community

What do you think are some of the best things the Portland tech community has going for it right now?

* Meetups: plenty of them, but tricky to network through them. Pressure to network? Differing goals; could be better for job purposes. Less pressure in an unstructured format (small groups, hack nights).
  * Useful if everyone introduces themselves.

What do you think the Portland tech community is missing out on or failing at right now?

* "I don't want to work on a project by myself - I want a group." Groups for setting up projects?
* Gap between grad and landing something.

How can the Portland tech community serve you better or best this year?

* Are there internships / entry-level positions or are the companies all betting on mid - senior developers to reduce learning time?
  * Forum of recruiters talking about what they are looking for.
  * How to argue for a sustainable supply that is neither a race to the bottom (UpWork) or exclusive high end (Top Talent). Value of investing in growth over time?
* Advice on how to network to reach the companies.
* Input from Project Managers on how to organize projects, what is valuable in industry. No need to limit to pure software work.
* Cannot gain the skill of company-style work without working on a team.
* Meetups do exist: Mentorship Saturdays, How to Land a Job in Tech, manager meetups.
* Getting into Open Source: First Issue Day? Some exist (Node Together). Rule of showing up - regular cadence of showing up leads to a deeper connection. See the subject of our previous talk, [Good First Issue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/good-first-issue).
  * If you have ideas for group OS projects or things to present on, [make an issue](https://github.com/PDXNode/pdxnode/issues/).

## Jobs

What do you want most from a tech job in Portland (or remote)?

* To have one (see above).
* Find the people on the ground (not the CEO - low-level managers and tech leads working with developers on a daily basis). Get their insights.
* Work-life balance.
* A fun job, that has a future, provides learning.
  * Advice: hang out with the people who are doing what / being like you want to be. Push each other to do the things you love, and grow more connected to the wider world.

What is good or bad about the Portland tech job scene right now?

* (skipped for time)

If you have an awesome tech job in Portland, what is it? What do you do? How'd you land it?

* (skipped for time)

What do you think is mot difficult about finding a coding job you like in Portland right now? How do you plan on surmounting the difficulties?

* Insight into management culture?

## Code Schools

What are the gaps between what you're learning & doing at your code school, and what you see and hear at meetups and job interviews?
(touched on first part earlier)

* Incentivizing senior people to attend. More cutting-edge presentations? Trade-off in terms of attracting senior developers and understandability.
  * Try visiting some of the other Meetups (e.g. Portland Linux User Group, C++, .Net) - plenty of senior developers, topics generally more abstract. How do we cross-pollinate the wisdom and applicability?
  * Recommendation: *Deep Work* by Cal Newport

What do you think are the problems that make it hard to get your first job after graduating from code school?

* Imposter syndrome (see *Cracking the Code Interview*). Don't worry too much - consider the Beer Factor (could the interviewer stand this person?).
  * Startups have less process/vetting, bigger risk of ending up in deep end.

## The Meetup Scene

What is most relevant to you about Meetups?

* (see above)

What Meetups in Portland (or abroad) are you jazzed about this year?

* [Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/portland): Coffee & Code; relaxed and practical.
* [Portland Data Science Group](https://www.meetup.com/Portland-Data-Science-Group/): project-focused.
* [Agile PDX](https://agilepdx.org) (see above)
* [Portland JavaScript Admirers](https://www.meetup.com/Portland-JavaScript-Admirers/)
* [Get Hired in Tech](https://www.meetup.com/Get-Hired-in-tech-and-healthcare/)

What do you thnk Meetups in Portland do well?

* Nametags with marking of seeking/hiring status.
* Huge range of options

What do you think Meetups in Portland could do well, but don't?

* Could have lower turnover / longer-lived connections.

What do you want to learn about this year?

How do you think a meetup group like pdxnode could help you with that?

Would you like to give a talk at pdxnode?

* If so, what about?

## Reflections, Improvements to be made

* This was good to have. We really needed this deeper level of feedback from attendees.
* There is interest in a broader set of topics beyond Node.js. We can draw a broader range of speakers, including more advanced ones that may be of interest to more experienced developers.
* Thanks for leading Ben! Thanks to Faddah for getting us through the last few months.

## Notes from organizer meeting

Short meeting to plan for a sustainable formt in 2020.

Priorities:

1. Sponsors: gather contact information, reach out, reimburse expenses.
2. Speakers: build a running list and try to recruit people at least a few months out.
3. Projects: build deeper involvement and portfolios.

* Need to centralize contact information and all other resources needed to run the group so that it is never held back by lack of access.
  * Shared Google Drive?
* Provide access to new organizing team members.
* Could we hold calls on a different day/evening? Anthony handling scheduling/Doodle.
