# I would love to hear a talk about:

Andrew has recently been working on[simple-scuttle](https://npmjs.org/package/simple-scuttle) based on Dominic
Tarr's [scuttlebutt](https://npmjs.org/package/scuttlebutt). He gave an
internal short demo at UA but I'd love to hear more about the fun we can have
with it as well as the challenges with creating it.
